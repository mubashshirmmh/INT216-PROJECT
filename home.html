                    <p>McNaughton leans on easy-to-identify pop-culture celebrity as subject matter,
                       while Carrey’s pop-culture bonafides cements his celebrity painter status.
                       Their cultural position is rooted in pop, and they’re on the list not for any one particular painting,
                       but more so because of the fence they ride between the art world and general pop culture, 
                       which have been circling each other closely since at least Warhol.

                        <p>Wiley, a Nigerian-American painter, has become one of the premier artists of the 21st century. 
                           "Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps" showcases the style for which Wiley became famous.
                           It reinterprets traditional oil portraiture to raise questions of race and societal class. 
                           This immense piece hangs in the lobby of the Brooklyn Museum in New York and helped established Wiley as a major player in the contemporary art scene.

                       <p>A young prodigy gone too soon at the age of 27, Jean-Michel Basquiat left a deep mark on contemporary art, 
                           but also the streets of 1980s New York, which he marked with his moniker SAMO. 
                           His Neo-Expressionistic paintings draw from his mixed descent and tackle topics such as racism, poverty,
                          and the universal human experience.

                                    an age-old technique of rolling, shaping, and gluing strips of paper to a surface. 
                                    Using this method, she is able to create astoundingly detailed and colorful compositions.

                                    <p>Georgia Totto O'Keeffe was an American artist. She was best known for her paintings of enlarged flowers, 
                                        New York skyscrapers, and New Mexico landscapes. 
                                        O'Keeffe has been recognized as the "Mother of American modernism"

                    <p>The tonal range of How’s landscape paintings are breathtakingly real. 
                        His works are almost sculptural in their density, but retain a resplendent glow. 
                        The soft, cool atmosphere he creates with his use of blues allow his landscapes to recede into a dreamy haze.

                    <p>Cheifetz’s builds exotic still lifes around color harmony. 
                        There is a mysterious quality to the subjects of his paintings, 
                        often illuminated with candlelight. 
                       The contrast of ornate detail with abstracted backgrounds create an interesting resonance.

                    <p>The twisted, contorted figures of Sarazhin appear to be reaching for connectedness. 
                        His subjects are enhanced by the warm and cool lights that flicker across their forms. 
                        The extreme gestures and emphasis on contour call to mind the work of Egon Schiele.

                        Set against muted backgrounds, her painted flowers, often peonies, 
                        have a luminous quality. With apparent admiration of her subjects, 
                        she renders each petal of her heavy-laden florals with graceful precision.

                    <h2>EMMA HOPKINS</h2>
                    <p>Hopkins is a refreshingly explorative figurative painter. 
                        Using a palette heavy in red, symbolic as the life giving color of blood, 
                        her work is an unabashed expression of sexuality, empowerment, and emotion. 
                        The fragmented cropping of her compositions increases the drama and tension of her subjects.
